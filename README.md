# interactive_cat_game

The aim was to develop an interactive game my cat loves to play with, and try to realise it on minimal hardware ressources, like the little ATtiny Microcontroller. 

A sensor recognises the cat movements. The ATtiny processes the sensor data and accordingly moves the motor an makes sounds through a buzzer. The algorithm activates the cat's hunting stimuli as well as possible by specific motor movements and sounds.

This repo doesnÂ´t present the source code but only presents the results.

Currently I try to minimize the necessary Hardware further. Fur this purpose I designed a PCB.
